If you are looking for a tropical getaway in your flight simulator, you might want to check out Richer Simulations' Caribsky Barbados 2017 scenery. This add-on covers the entire island of Barbados and its main airport, Grantley Adams International (TBPB), with high-resolution photoreal textures, custom autogen, dynamic lighting, animated traffic and more. It also includes a free expansion pack that adds the new Argyle International Airport (TVSA) in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
 
Richer Simulations is a developer that specializes in creating scenery for the Caribbean region, and they have done a great job in capturing the beauty and diversity of Barbados. The island is famous for its white-sand beaches, coral reefs, historic buildings and lush vegetation, and you can see all of these features in stunning detail in Caribsky Barbados 2017. The scenery is compatible with FSX, FSX:SE and Prepar3D versions 1 to 4, and it is DRM free, meaning you can install it on multiple computers without any activation issues.

The airport of Grantley Adams International is the main gateway to Barbados and one of the busiest in the Caribbean. It has a single runway that can accommodate large jets such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, as well as smaller regional aircraft. The airport has been faithfully recreated by Richer Simulations, with accurate buildings, signs, markings, lighting and animations. You can also see realistic ground vehicles, static aircraft and AI traffic moving around the airport.
