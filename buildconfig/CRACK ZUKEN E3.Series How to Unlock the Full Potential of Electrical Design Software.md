In this article, we will explain what Zuken E3.series is, what are its main features and benefits, and how it can improve your electrical design process and productivity.
  
## What is Zuken E3.series?
 
Zuken E3.series is a comprehensive electrical and fluid planning software environment that covers all aspects of electrical design: functional design, detailed schematics (electrical and fluid), wiring and tubing diagrams, control cabinet and wire harness layout in 2D and 3D, reports, and manufacturing documentation[^1^] [^2^].
 
E3.series is driven by an intelligent database that enables electrical and logical checks that ensure correct connections by design. It also connects to leading MCAD design platforms to streamline the creation of digital twins. Moreover, it integrates with existing PLM and PDM systems to manage electrical data throughout the product lifecycle. E3.series also supports collaboration between teams of different sizes and locations with enterprise-level options[^1^] [^2^].
  
## What are the main features and benefits of Zuken E3.series?
 
Zuken E3.series offers a range of features and benefits that make it a powerful and versatile solution for electrical design. Some of them are:
 
- **Design automation:** E3.series optimizes every aspect of electrical design with automation options that enhance consistency, quality, accuracy, and speed. You can use built-in tools or customize your own workflows with the open API[^1^] [^2^].
- **Wire harness design and manufacturing ecosystem:** E3.series empowers wire harness engineers to take advantage of innovative automated test, assembly, and manufacturing solutions to stay ahead of the competition. You can create wire harness designs in 2D or 3D, generate formboards, export data to cutting machines, label printers, test equipment, etc[^1^] [^2^].
- **Cabinet design and manufacturing ecosystem:** E3.series simplifies the design of control cabinets, switchgear, PLCs, motor control centers, and power distribution systems. You can create cabinet layouts in 2D or 3D, generate bills of materials (BOMs), wiring lists, terminal plans, etc. You can also leverage smart cabinet building processes to streamline everything from engineering to service[^1^] [^2^].
- **Intelligent shared library:** E3.series provides a unified library that contains components and symbols for electrical and fluid design. You can reuse components and symbols across different projects while retaining associated parts and signals. You can also import data from external sources or create your own custom components and symbols[^1^] [^2^].
- **Digital connectivity:** E3.series connects to leading MCAD design platforms such as SolidWorks, Creo Parametric, Inventor, NX, etc. to enable seamless data exchange and synchronization between electrical and mechanical domains. You can also integrate E3.series with existing PLM and PDM systems such as Teamcenter, Windchill, SAP PLM, etc. to manage electrical data throughout the product lifecycle[^1^] [^2^].

## How can Zuken E3.series improve your electrical design process and productivity?
 
Zuken E3.series can help you improve your electrical design process and productivity in many ways. Some of them are:

- **Reduce errors and rework:** E3.series ensures correct connections by design with its intelligent database and electrical checks. It also prevents errors due to manual data entry or outdated information with its digital connectivity and data management capabilities[^1^] [^2^].
- **Save time and costs:** E3.series speeds up your electrical design process with its automation options and efficient tools. It also reduces your manufacturing costs by optimizing your material usage
