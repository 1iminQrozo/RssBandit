# How to Convert SOR Files to PDF Online
 
SOR files are a type of optical test data file that contain information about fiber optic cables, such as length, attenuation, and events. They are generated by devices called optical time-domain reflectometers (OTDRs), which measure the characteristics of optical fibers. SOR files can be viewed and analyzed by specialized software, but they are not widely compatible with other applications or devices.

PDF files, on the other hand, are a universal document format that can be opened and viewed by almost any device or program. PDF files can also preserve the layout, quality, and security of the original document. PDF files are ideal for sharing, printing, and archiving documents.
 
Therefore, converting SOR files to PDF can be useful for various purposes, such as presenting test results, sending reports to clients or colleagues, or storing data for future reference.
