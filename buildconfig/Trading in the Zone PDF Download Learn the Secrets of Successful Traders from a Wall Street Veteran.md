However, BarTender is not a cheap software. The standard edition costs $495 per license, while the professional edition costs $795 per license. If you need more advanced features such as database connectivity, RFID encoding and web printing, you will have to pay even more for the automation or enterprise editions.
 
So, how can you get BarTender barcode software for free with crack for 574? Well, there are some websites that claim to offer cracked versions of BarTender that can bypass the license activation and verification process. However, these websites are not trustworthy and may contain malware, viruses or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
 
Moreover, using cracked software is illegal and unethical. You are violating the intellectual property rights of the software developer and exposing yourself to potential legal consequences. You are also depriving yourself of the benefits of official updates, support and security patches that can improve the performance and reliability of the software.

- Use a free or open source barcode software. There are some free or open source barcode software that can perform basic tasks such as generating and printing barcodes. For example, you can try Zint Barcode Studio, Libre Barcode or Barcode Generator.
- Use an online barcode generator. There are some online barcode generators that can create and download barcodes in various formats such as PNG, JPG or PDF. For example, you can try Online Barcode Generator, Barcode Generator Online or Free Barcode Generator.

In conclusion, BarTender is a great barcode software that offers many features and benefits.
