After downloading Rufus, follow these steps to create a bootable USB drive or DVD:
 
1. Launch Rufus and then select the drive in which you want to create the bootable media. Make sure you have backed up any important data on the drive as it will be formatted.
2. Click on the "SELECT" button and browse to the location where you saved the Windows 7 X4 ISO file. Select the file and click "Open".
3. Make sure the "Partition scheme" is set to "MBR" and the "Target system" is set to "BIOS or UEFI". Leave the other settings as default.
4. Click on the "START" button and wait for Rufus to create the bootable media. This may take several minutes depending on your system speed and USB/DVD quality.
5. When Rufus is done, you will see a message saying "READY". You can now close Rufus and eject the USB drive or DVD.

## Step 3: Install Windows 7 X4 on Your PC
 
The final step is to install Windows 7 X4 on your PC using the bootable USB drive or DVD. You will need to change the boot order of your PC to boot from the USB/DVD first. This can be done by entering the BIOS setup of your PC, which usually requires pressing a key like F2, F10, F12, or Del during startup. Refer to your PC manual or manufacturer website for more details.
 
Once you have changed the boot order, follow these steps to install Windows 7 X4 on your PC:

1. Restart your PC and wait for it to boot from the USB/DVD. You will see a screen with "Windows is loading files..." message.
2. After that, you will see a screen with "Starting Windows" message and a colorful animation.
3. Then, you will see a screen with language, time and currency format, and keyboard input method options. Choose your preferences and click "Next".
