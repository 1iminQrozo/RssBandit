The film is not a biopic or a remake of Ghatak's famous film of the same name, but rather a homage to his artistic vision and social commentary. The film explores Nilkantha's relationship with his family, friends, colleagues, and students, as well as his creative process and political views. The film also recreates some of the iconic scenes and dialogues from Ghatak's films, such as Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), Komal Gandhar (1961), Subarnarekha (1962), and Jukti Takko Aar Gappo (1974).
 
Meghe Dhaka Tara received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music, and performances. The film won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali and the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) for Saswata Chatterjee. The film was also screened at various international film festivals, such as the Busan International Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, and the London Indian Film Festival.

Ritwik Ghatak was born on 4 November 1925 in Dhaka, which was then part of the British India and is now the capital of Bangladesh. He belonged to a prominent family of writers and activists, such as his brother Manish Ghatak and his niece Mahasweta Devi. He was deeply influenced by the partition of India in 1947, which divided Bengal into two parts and displaced millions of people. He witnessed the horrors of communal violence and famine, which left a lasting mark on his psyche and art.
 
Ghatak started his career as a playwright and actor in the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), a cultural wing of the Communist Party of India. He wrote several plays, such as Kalo Sayar (The Dark Lake), Dalil (The Document), and Jwala (The Flame), which dealt with social and political issues. He also acted in some plays, such as Nabanna (The New Harvest), which depicted the Bengal famine of 1943.
 
Ghatak made his debut as a film director with Nagarik (The Citizen) in 1952, which was one of the first realistic films in Indian cinema. The film portrayed the plight of a middle-class family in Calcutta, struggling with poverty and unemployment. The film was not released until 1977, after Ghatak's death. His next film Ajantrik (Pathetic Fallacy) in 1958 was a comedy-drama about a taxi driver and his old car. The film was praised for its humanism and humor, and was one of the earliest examples of Indian art cinema.
