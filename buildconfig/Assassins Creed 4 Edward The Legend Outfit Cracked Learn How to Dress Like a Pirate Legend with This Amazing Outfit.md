Now that you know how to unlock Edward the Legend Outfit, you might be wondering how to make the most of your pirate adventure in Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you become a master assassin and a feared pirate.
 
## 1. Upgrade your Jackdaw
 
The Jackdaw is your ship and your home in the game. You will use it to travel, fight, and plunder across the Caribbean. Upgrading your Jackdaw is essential to survive the naval battles and take down bigger and stronger ships. You can upgrade your Jackdaw by buying new weapons, armor, sails, figureheads, and more from the harbormaster or from your captain's cabin. You will need money and resources to do so, which you can get by looting enemy ships, warehouses, chests, and animals.
 
## 2. Use your spyglass
 
Your spyglass is a useful tool that allows you to scout your surroundings and identify potential targets. You can use it to zoom in on enemy ships and see their level, type, cargo, and weak points. You can also use it to spot forts, islands, animals, treasure maps, and other points of interest. Using your spyglass will also mark these locations on your map for future reference.
