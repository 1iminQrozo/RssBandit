Mifare Classic cards are widely used for access control, public transportation, and other applications that require secure data storage. However, these cards are vulnerable to some attacks that can compromise their security and expose their data. In this article, we will show you how to use two open source tools, MFCUK and MFOC, to recover data from Mifare Classic cards.
  
## What are MFCUK and MFOC?
  
MFCUK stands for MiFare Classic Universal toolKit. It is a tool that can perform a "dark side" attack on Mifare Classic cards, which exploits a weakness in the Crypto1 algorithm used by these cards. The attack allows to recover the secret keys (A and B) of a card by using a known key or a default key. The tool can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfcuk)[^1^].

MFOC stands for MiFare Classic Offline Cracker. It is a tool that can perform an "offline nested" attack on Mifare Classic cards, which is based on the research by Nethemba. The attack allows to recover the secret keys (A and B) of a card by using a single known key or a default key. The tool can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfoc)[^2^].
  
## How to Use MFCUK and MFOC?
  
To use these tools, you will need a compatible NFC reader that supports libnfc, such as the Proxmark3 or the ACR122U. You will also need a Mifare Classic card that you want to recover data from. The steps are as follows:
  
1. Connect your NFC reader to your computer and make sure it is recognized by libnfc.
2. Place the Mifare Classic card near the reader.
3. Run the command `mfcuk -C -R 0:A -v 2` to start the dark side attack using sector 0 key A as the known key. You can change the sector and the key type according to your situation. The attack may take some time depending on the card and the reader.
4. If the attack is successful, you will see the output of the recovered keys (A and B) for each sector of the card. You can save these keys to a file for later use.
5. Run the command `mfoc -O dump.mfd -k <key>` to start the offline nested attack using one of the recovered keys as the known key. You can specify multiple keys using the -k option. The attack will try to recover all the keys of the card and dump its data to a file called dump.mfd.
6. If the attack is successful, you will see the output of the recovered keys (A and B) for each sector of the card and a message saying "Dumping keys to a file". You can open the dump.mfd file with a hex editor or a tool like [Mifare Classic Tool](https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool)[^3^] to view and edit its data.

## Conclusion
  
In this article, we have shown you how to use MFCUK and MFOC tools to recover data from Mifare Classic cards. These tools are useful for security testing, research, or backup purposes. However, they also demonstrate the weaknesses of Mifare Classic cards and the need for more secure alternatives. We hope you have learned something useful from this article and enjoyed reading it.
