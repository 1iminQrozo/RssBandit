Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3 is a tool that allows you to inject ROMs or homebrew into WAD files for the Nintendo Wii. WAD files are packages that contain channels, games, or other content that can be installed on the Wii's system menu. By injecting ROMs into WAD files, you can play retro games or custom games on your Wii without using an emulator.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3 to inject ROMs into WAD files. You will need the following:
 
**Download File –––––>>> [https://t.co/zSXpqw8vl7](https://t.co/zSXpqw8vl7)**


 
- A Windows PC
- A common-key.bin file (this is a file that contains the encryption key for Wii content. It is illegal to distribute, so you will have to find it yourself on the internet)
- A base WAD file (this is a WAD file that contains a channel or game that you want to replace with your ROM. You can find some base WAD files online, or dump them from your own Wii using a homebrew app)
- A ROM file (this is a file that contains the game or homebrew that you want to inject into the base WAD file. It can be a NES, SNES, Genesis, or TurboGrafx-16 ROM. Make sure it is not interleaved for Genesis ROMs)
- Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3 (this is the tool that we will use to inject the ROM into the WAD file. You can download it from [here](https://gbatemp.net/download/auto-injectuwad-injector.37110/))

Once you have all the files ready, follow these steps:

1. Extract the Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3 zip file to a folder on your PC.
2. Copy the common-key.bin file to the same folder.
3. Run Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3.exe.
4. Select the base WAD file by clicking on the "..." button next to "Base Wad".
5. Select the ROM file by clicking on the "..." button next to "Rom".
6. Select the mode according to the type of ROM you are injecting. For NES, SNES, and TurboGrafx-16 ROMs, select "Normal". For Genesis ROMs, select "Genesis".
7. Click on "Inject".
8. Wait for the process to finish. You will see a message saying "Injection Complete!" when it is done.
9. You will find a new WAD file in the same folder as Auto InjectuWAD Injector v3.exe. The name of the file will be "[Base Wad Name]\_[Rom Name].wad". This is the injected WAD file that contains your ROM.
10. Copy the injected WAD file to your SD card or USB drive.
11. Install the injected WAD file on your Wii using a homebrew app such as WAD Manager or Multi-Mod Manager.
12. Enjoy your injected game!

Note: Not every ROM will run perfectly or run on any base WAD file. Some ROMs may have compatibility issues, graphical glitches, sound problems, or other errors. You may have to try different base WAD files or different ROMs until you find one that works well. Also, be careful when installing WAD files on your Wii, as installing corrupted or malicious WAD files may brick your Wii.

## How to Customize Your Injected WAD File
