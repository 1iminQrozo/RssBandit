## Installation
 
Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery is easy to install and does not require any complex procedures or manual editing of files. The product comes with an installer that will detect your sim location and add the scenery.cfg entry for FSX, FSX:SE, P3Dv1 and P3Dv4[^1^]. You can also choose to install the scenery manually if you prefer. The product requires about 1 GB of disk space.
 
## Performance
 
Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery is optimized for performance and does not cause any significant impact on your frame rates or loading times. The product uses high quality textures and models that are balanced with the level of detail and complexity. The product also supports dynamic lighting and SODE jetways for P3Dv4 users, which enhance the realism and immersion of the scenery. However, these features may require higher system specifications and settings to run smoothly.
 
## Compatibility
 
Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery is compatible with FSX, FSX:SE, P3Dv1, P3Dv4 and P3Dv5. It is also compatible with AI traffic and other scenery add-ons that cover the Azores region or Portugal. However, some minor conflicts or overlaps may occur with some products that use different mesh or landclass data. In such cases, you may need to adjust the scenery library order or disable some features to avoid any issues.
 
## Comparison
 
Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery is one of the best scenery add-ons available for Lajes Airport and the Azores region. It offers a high level of detail, realism and accuracy that surpasses the default scenery and other alternatives in the market. The product also has a reasonable price tag of EUR 19.90 (or EUR 9.90 if you have previously purchased Tropical Sim Azores 3 or Tropical Sim Lajes LPLA FS9 FSX P3D at simMarket). However, if you are looking for a more comprehensive scenery package that covers all nine islands of the Azores archipelago, you may want to consider Tropical Sim Azores 3 instead. This product includes Lajes Airport as well as eight other airports in the region, with similar features and quality as Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery.
 
## Conclusion
 
Tropical Sim LPLA Scenery is a must-have for any flight simulator
