Jevandjelje Po Judi.pdf is a PDF document that contains a translation of the Gospel of Judas, a gnostic text that was discovered in the late 20th century. The Gospel of Judas is a dialogue between Jesus and Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who betrayed him to the Jewish authorities. Unlike the canonical gospels, which portray Judas as a traitor who led Jesus to his crucifixion, the Gospel of Judas depicts Judas as a faithful follower who obeyed Jesus' command to hand him over. The Gospel of Judas also suggests that Jesus planned his own death as a way to free himself from the physical limitations of his human body.
  
The Gospel of Judas is an interesting and controversial document that sheds light on the diversity and complexity of early Christianity. It challenges some of the traditional beliefs and doctrines of mainstream Christianity, such as the nature and role of Jesus, the meaning and purpose of his death, and the fate and salvation of humanity. It also reveals some of the beliefs and practices of the gnostics, a group of Christians who claimed to have a special knowledge (gnosis) of God and the spiritual world. The gnostics believed that there were two types of people: those who had an immortal soul that belonged to the "realm of eternity" and those who were mortal and could not attain salvation. They also believed that the material world was created by a lesser god (the Demiurge) who was ignorant or hostile to the true God.

## What is Gnosticism and How Does It Relate to the Gospel of Judas?
  
Gnosticism is a term that scholars use to describe a variety of religious movements that emerged in the Greco-Roman world in the early centuries of Christianity. The word gnosticism comes from the Greek gnosis, which means "knowledge". Gnostics claimed to have a special, secret knowledge of God and the spiritual world that was different from the orthodox teachings of the church. They also believed that the material world was evil and corrupt, and that humans needed to escape from it by attaining gnosis.
  
Gnosticism was not a unified or coherent system, but rather a diverse and complex phenomenon that included many different groups, sects, and schools. Some of these groups identified themselves as Christian, while others were influenced by Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Platonism, or other traditions. Some of the most famous gnostic groups were the Valentinians, the Sethians, the Basilidians, and the Manichaeans. Each group had its own myths, rituals, scriptures, and practices.
  
The Gospel of Judas is one of the gnostic texts that have been discovered in modern times. It belongs to a category of gnostic literature known as apocryphal gospels, which are alternative accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus that differ from the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The Gospel of Judas reflects some of the distinctive features of gnosticism, such as:
  
- The rejection of the creator God of the Old Testament as a lesser or ignorant deity (the Demiurge) who trapped humans in a material world.
- The identification of Jesus as a revealer or messenger of the true God (the Monad) who came to impart gnosis to his followers.
- The portrayal of Judas as a hero or martyr who helped Jesus to accomplish his mission by betraying him.
- The criticism of the other disciples as ignorant or misled by false teachings.
- The emphasis on a spiritual resurrection rather than a bodily one.

The Gospel of Judas is an example of how gnostics interpreted and reimagined the Christian tradition in light of their own worldview and experience. It challenges some of the core beliefs and values of mainstream Christianity and offers a different perspective on the meaning and significance of Jesus and Judas.
