The Final Destination franchise is one of the most successful horror series of all time, with five films that have grossed over $665 million worldwide. The films are known for their creative and gruesome death scenes, which involve elaborate chains of events that lead to the demise of the characters who cheated death.
 
The franchise is based on an unproduced spec script by Jeffrey Reddick, who was inspired by a story about a woman who changed her flight after having a bad feeling and avoided a plane crash. Reddick originally wrote the script as an episode of The X-Files, but later turned it into a feature film with the help of James Wong and Glen Morgan, who directed and co-wrote the first and third films.
 
The franchise has a loyal fan base that enjoys the thrill and suspense of watching the characters try to outsmart death and decipher the clues that hint at their fate. The films also have a dark sense of humor and often reference other horror movies and pop culture. The franchise has spawned two comic books and nine novels that expand on the stories and characters of the films.
